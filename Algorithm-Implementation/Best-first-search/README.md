# Best-First Search

## How the Algorithm Works
Best-first search is a search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule, usually a heuristic function. It uses a priority queue to always expand the node that appears to be closest to the goal.

## Applications
- Pathfinding in games and maps
- Puzzle solving
- Artificial intelligence planning

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(b^d), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth
- Space complexity: O(b^d)

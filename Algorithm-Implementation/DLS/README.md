# Depth-Limited Search (DLS)

## How the Algorithm Works
Depth-Limited Search is a variant of Depth-First Search (DFS) where the search is limited to a predetermined depth. It explores as far as possible along each branch up to the specified limit before backtracking.

## Applications
- Solving puzzles with a known depth limit
- Game tree exploration
- Avoiding infinite loops in graphs with cycles

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(b^l), where b is the branching factor and l is the depth limit
- Space complexity: O(l)

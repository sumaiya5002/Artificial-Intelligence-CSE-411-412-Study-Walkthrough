# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## How the Algorithm Works
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit next.

## Applications
- Shortest path finding in unweighted graphs
- Web crawling
- Social network analysis
- Network broadcasting

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
- Space complexity: O(V)

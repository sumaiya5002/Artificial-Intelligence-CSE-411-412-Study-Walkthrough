# Hill Climbing

## How the Algorithm Works
Hill climbing is a heuristic search algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution and iteratively makes small changes to the solution, each time moving to a neighbor with a better value, until no further improvements can be found.

## Applications
- Function optimization
- Scheduling problems
- Pathfinding in AI

## Complexity
- Time complexity: Depends on the landscape; can be O(n) for simple cases
- Space complexity: O(1)

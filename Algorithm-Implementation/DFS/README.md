# Depth-First Search (DFS)

## How the Algorithm Works
Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS uses a stack (either explicitly or via recursion) to keep track of the path.

## Applications
- Topological sorting
- Cycle detection in graphs
- Solving puzzles and mazes
- Pathfinding

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
- Space complexity: O(V)

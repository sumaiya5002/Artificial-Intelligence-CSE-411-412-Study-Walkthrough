# AO* Algorithm

## How the Algorithm Works
AO* (And-Or Star) is a search algorithm used for solving problems that can be represented as AND-OR graphs. It finds the least-cost solution by recursively evaluating nodes, considering both AND and OR relationships between subproblems, and updating the solution graph as it explores.

## Applications
- Automated planning
- Problem solving in AI (e.g., expert systems)
- Decision making with multiple solution paths

## Complexity
- Time complexity: Exponential in the worst case, depending on the structure of the AND-OR graph
- Space complexity: Depends on the number of nodes in the graph

# Min-Max Algorithm

## How the Algorithm Works
The Min-Max algorithm is used in decision-making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming the opponent also plays optimally. It recursively explores all possible moves, choosing the move that maximizes the player's minimum gain (or minimizes the opponent's maximum gain).

## Applications
- Game AI (Chess, Tic Tac Toe, Checkers)
- Decision making in adversarial environments

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(b^d), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the game tree
- Space complexity: O(bd)

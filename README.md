# AI Projects for CSE 411 & 412

## Course Overview

Purpose:
This course is designed to introduce students to the core concepts and practical applications of Artificial Intelligence. The main focus is on classic search algorithms and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. The goal is to help students develop strong problem-solving skills and understand the impact of AI in various fields.

What I learned:
Throughout this course, I learned how to implement classic AI search algorithms using Python and JavaScript. I also explored how these algorithms can be applied in games like Chess and Tic Tac Toe, as well as in solving mazes. The course helped me analyze the complexity and performance of different algorithms, build interactive demos and graphical interfaces, and improve my ability to present and explain technical ideas.

## About the Algorithms

How the algorithms work:
The algorithms in this repository are designed to solve search and decision-making problems. For example, A*, Best-First, Beam, BFS, DFS, DLS, IDS, and Bidirectional Search are used to explore paths in graphs or mazes to find the best or a feasible solution. Hill Climbing is a heuristic-based approach that tries to improve the solution step by step. Min-Max and Alpha-Beta are used in game AI to choose the best moves by simulating possible future states. AO* is useful for problems with multiple solution paths, especially in AND-OR graphs.

Applications:
These algorithms have a wide range of applications. Pathfinding algorithms like A*, BFS, and DFS are used in robotics, navigation systems, and puzzle solving. Game AI algorithms such as Min-Max and Alpha-Beta are used in games like Chess and Tic Tac Toe. They are also useful in automated planning, decision making, and optimization problems.

Complexity:
- BFS and DFS have a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- A* can be as efficient as O(E) with a good heuristic, but in the worst case, it can be exponential.
- Min-Max has a complexity of O(b^d), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the game tree.
- Alpha-Beta pruning can reduce this to O(b^(d/2)) with optimal move ordering.
- Hill Climbing's complexity depends on the problem landscape, but it can be O(n) for simple cases.
- Beam Search has a complexity of O(b * d), where b is the beam width and d is the depth.

Input & Output Images:
Please check the individual project folders for sample input and output images. I recommend keeping screenshots of your programâ€™s input and output to help illustrate how the algorithms work in practice.

# Artificial Intelligence Course Overview

## Purpose of the Course
The primary purpose of this course was to develop familiarity with the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including its foundational concepts, theoretical frameworks, and real-world applications. The course introduced key AI terminologies, constraint satisfaction problems, and essential problem-solving strategies. It focused on how AI works and how it can be applied effectively in various domains, such as games and real-life scenarios.

## What I Learned from the Course

### üß† Theory
- Introduction to AI and its applications
- Types of AI: Narrow, General, Super
- Intelligent Agents: Simple Reflex, Model-Based, Goal-Based, Utility-Based
- Search Strategies (Uninformed & Informed)
- Game Playing in AI
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
- Consistency in CSP
- Branch and Bound Algorithm
- Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
- Uncertainty, Probability, Bayesian Inference
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Robotics and Machine Perception

### ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Implemented
- Uninformed Search Algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), Depth-Limited Search (DLS), Bidirectional Search
- Informed Search Algorithms: Heuristic Search, Best-First Search, A* Algorithm, AO* Algorithm, Hill Climbing, Beam Search
- Game Playing Algorithms: Minimax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning
- All algorithms are implemented in the Algorithm-Implementation folder, each with its own subfolder and README.
